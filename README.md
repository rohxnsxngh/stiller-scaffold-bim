 there is a conflict between the version of the three package required by your project (three@0.160.1) and the version required by the openbim-components package (three@0.152.2).

downgrading a package might affect other parts of your project that rely on features or fixes introduced in later versions of the package. Make sure to thoroughly test your project after making this change.
