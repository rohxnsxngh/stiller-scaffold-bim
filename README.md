there is a conflict between the version of the three package required by your project (three@0.160.1) and the version required by the openbim-components package (three@0.152.2).

# Shapes

Most build tools are based on the concept of blueprints with rectangular shapes.This is because most commercial designs are rectangular, or square, is because they are easier, faster and more economical to build out of ordinary materials â€“ stone, concrete, brick or wood. Square and rectangular shapes are also exponentially easier to reconcile, and there's usually less waste.
